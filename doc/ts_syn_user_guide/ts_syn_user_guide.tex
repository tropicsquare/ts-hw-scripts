\TsSection{Introduction}

This document is a user guide for synthesis flow that is part of ts-hw-scripts. The flow consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{ts_syn_run.py} Main script of the ts-hw-scripts synthesis flow.
\end{itemize}

The synthesis flow expects input files:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{ts_sim_config.yml} Simulation config file specifying an RTL target and source lists for the synthesis
    \item \textit{ts_design_config.yml} Design config file specifying used IPs and design libraries
    \item \textit{ts_pdk_config.yml} PDK config file specifying available PDK
\end{itemize}

The synthesis flow generates these files:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{design_cfg.tcl} Auto-generated TCL script consists of available PDK digital views used by synthesis
    \item \textit{synthesis_setup.tcl} Auto-generated TCL script replacing DCRM-flow "common_setup.tcl". Used as a bridge between TS-flow and DCRM-flow
    \item \textit{source_rtl.tcl} Auto-generated TCL script for sourcing RTL for a synthesis run according to a target
    \item \textit{ts_open_synthesis.tcl} Auto-generated TCL script for opening a synthesis results regarding a runcode.
\end{itemize}

\OpenIssue{It might be good to describe output of Synthesis flow briefly (netlist/reports/esported constraints/dont_touch list, etc...)}
