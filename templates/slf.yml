# Description:
#   This file specifies list of HDL source files used as an input for various
#   CAD tools (simulator, synthesizer, ...).
#
#   Validity of content of this file is checked by TS HW Scripts.
#
#   Keys of slf.yml file
#   ====================
#
#   1) library
#      Defines name of HDL library into which the sources will be compiled.
#      A global compilation library is required in each source list file. The
#      scripting system does not allow relying on default ("work") library.
#
#   2) define (optional)
#      Defines global macros that will be applied during compilation of any
#      Verilog/SystemVerilog file specified in source_list (see later). VHDL
#      (until 2019) has no concept of pre-processor macros therefore any
#      defined macros are ignored for VHDL files.
#
#   3) include_dirs (optional)
#      Defines directories where CAD tool will look for Verilog/SystemVerilog
#      header files when compiling any of the files specified in source_list
#      (see later). Include directories are ignored for VHDL files since VHDL
#      has no concept of header files. Relative path are interpreted as
#      relative to source list file itself (not to $TS_REPO_ROOT). Absolute
#      paths are interpreted as absolute paths.
#
#   4) source_list
#      Defines list of source files. A value of this source list shall be
#      a YAML list.
#      a) file                    - source file or nested YAML source list
#                                   file to be compiled
#      c) library (optional)      - same as 1) library but applies to
#                                   currently compiled source file only
#      d) lang (optional)         - language of currently compiled source
#                                   file. Useful when non-standard file
#                                   extention is used and language cannot be
#                                   obtained automatically. Supported values:
#                                   vhdl, verilog, system_verilog.
#      e) comp_options (optional) - compilation switches to be added when
#                                   compiling current source file. These
#                                   switches are appended to global compilation
#                                   options.
#      f) include_dirs (optional) - same as 3) include_dirs but applies to
#                                   currently compiled source file only
#      g) define (optional)       - same as 2) define but applies to currently
#                                   compiled source file only
